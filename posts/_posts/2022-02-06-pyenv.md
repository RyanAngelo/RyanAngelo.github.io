Pyenv can make managing multiple versions of python a lot easier. Pyenv allows you to easily select, install and compile specific versions of python for testing and development.

## Setting up PyEnv

Using [Brew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
brew update
brew install pyenv
```

Install the dependencies requires to build Python.
This includes the Xcode Command Line Tools and a few libraries.

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib
```

Then add Pyenv to your path (In this case .zshrc):

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
```

## Installing a Python version

Install the Python version of your choice.
These are installed to $(pyenv root)/versions

```bash
pyenv install <version number>
```

To see what versions are available:

```bash
pyenv install --list
```
