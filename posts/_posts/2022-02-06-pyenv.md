Pyenv can make managing multiple versions of python a lot easier. Pyenv allows you to easily select, install and compile specific versions of python for testing and development.

## Setting up PyEnv

Using [Brew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
brew update
brew install pyenv
```
## What is Pyenv?

Pyenv is a powerful tool that lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. This is particularly useful when:

- Different projects require different Python versions
- You need to test your code against multiple Python versions
- You want to try new Python features without affecting your system Python

Some key benefits of using Pyenv:

- Doesn't require sudo access - installs everything in your home directory
- Can set Python versions per-project or globally
- Manages virtual environments (with pyenv-virtualenv plugin)
- Works seamlessly with common development tools

## Prerequisites

Before installing Pyenv, you'll need:

1. A macOS system
2. Command line tools installed
3. A package manager (Homebrew recommended)
4. Basic familiarity with terminal commands

## Installation Steps

First, we'll use Homebrew to install Pyenv. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can get it from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).

Install the dependencies requires to build Python.
This includes the Xcode Command Line Tools and a few libraries.

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib
```

Then add Pyenv to your path (In this case .zshrc):

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
```

## Installing a Python version

Install the Python version of your choice.
These are installed to $(pyenv root)/versions

```bash
pyenv install <version number>
```

To see what versions are available:

```bash
pyenv install --list
```

## Common Pyenv Commands

Here are some essential pyenv commands for daily use:

```bash
# List all available Python versions for installation
pyenv install --list

# Install a specific Python version
pyenv install 3.9.0

# List installed Python versions
pyenv versions

# Set global Python version
pyenv global 3.9.0

# Set local Python version (per directory)
pyenv local 3.9.0

# Set Python version for current shell session
pyenv shell 3.9.0

# Uninstall a specific Python version
pyenv uninstall 3.9.0

# Show current Python version
pyenv version

# Display full path to executable
pyenv which python

# Update pyenv itself (via homebrew)
brew upgrade pyenv
```

## Working with Virtual Environments

If you're using the pyenv-virtualenv plugin (recommended), here are useful commands:

```bash
# Install pyenv-virtualenv plugin
brew install pyenv-virtualenv

# Create a new virtual environment
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.0 my-virtual-env

# Activate a virtual environment
pyenv activate my-virtual-env

# Deactivate current virtual environment
pyenv deactivate

# Delete a virtual environment
pyenv virtualenv-delete my-virtual-env

# List all virtual environments
pyenv virtualenvs
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues after installation:

1. Make sure your shell configuration is correct by adding these lines to your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"  # If using virtualenv plugin
```

2. Rehash pyenv after installing new versions:

```bash
pyenv rehash
```

3. If build fails, ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib tcl-tk
```
