## Introduction

GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) programming has evolved far beyond graphics rendering to become a cornerstone of modern high-performance computing. GPUs excel at parallel processing tasks, making them ideal for machine learning, scientific computing, data analysis, and more.

### Why GPU Programming?

- **Massive Parallelism**: Thousands of cores working simultaneously
- **High Memory Bandwidth**: Optimized for data-intensive operations
- **Cost-Effective**: Better performance per dollar than traditional CPUs for parallel workloads
- **Wide Adoption**: Essential for AI/ML, scientific computing, and financial modeling

## Key Concepts

### Parallel Processing Model
GPUs use a Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) architecture where many cores execute the same instruction on different data simultaneously.

### Memory Hierarchy
- **Global Memory**: Large, high-latency memory accessible by all threads
- **Shared Memory**: Fast, on-chip memory shared within thread blocks
- **Local Memory**: Per-thread private memory
- **Constant Memory**: Read-only memory cached for fast access
- **Texture Memory**: Optimized for spatial locality

### Thread Organization
- **Grid**: Collection of thread blocks
- **Block**: Group of threads that can cooperate and share memory
- **Thread**: Individual execution unit
- **Warp**: Group of 32 threads (CUDA) that execute in lockstep

## Programming Models

### CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)
NVIDIA's proprietary parallel computing platform and programming model.

**Key Features:**
- C/C++ extensions for GPU programming
- Extensive tooling and documentation
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs

**Basic CUDA Program Structure:**
```cuda
__global__ void kernel_function(int *data, int n) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        data[idx] = data[idx] * 2;  // Example operation
    }
}

int main() {
    // Host memory allocation
    int *h_data, *d_data;
    // Device memory allocation
    cudaMalloc(&d_data, size);
    // Copy data to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    // Launch kernel
    kernel_function<<<blocks, threads>>>(d_data, n);
    // Copy results back
    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    return 0;
}
```

### OpenCL (Open Computing Language)
Cross-platform, open standard for parallel programming.

**Key Features:**
- Vendor-agnostic (works on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel GPUs)
- C-based programming language
- Runtime compilation
- More complex setup but greater flexibility

### Modern Alternatives

**HIP (Heterogeneous-Computing Interface for Portability)**
- AMD's CUDA portability layer
- Allows CUDA code to run on AMD GPUs
- Useful for cross-platform development

**SYCL (SYCL)**
- C++ abstraction layer for heterogeneous computing
- Single-source programming model
- Part of the C++ standard

**WebGPU**
- Web standard for GPU computing
- Enables GPU programming in web browsers
- JavaScript/TypeScript API

### Best Practices

1. **Memory Management**
   - Minimize host-device transfers
   - Use pinned memory for frequent transfers
   - Align memory accesses

2. **Thread Organization**
   - Choose appropriate block sizes (typically 256-1024 threads)
   - Ensure sufficient occupancy
   - Avoid thread divergence

3. **Optimization**
   - Profile before optimizing
   - Focus on memory bandwidth first
   - Use shared memory effectively
   - Minimize register usage

4. **Debugging**
   - Use proper error checking
   - Validate results on CPU first
   - Use debugging tools and assertions

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Memory Leaks**: Always free device memory
2. **Synchronization**: Understand when synchronization is needed
3. **Thread Divergence**: Avoid conditional branches that cause threads to diverge
4. **Memory Coalescing**: Ensure memory accesses are coalesced for optimal performance

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Bandwidth**: Often the limiting factor
- **Occupancy**: Balance between register usage and thread count
- **Instruction Throughput**: Choose appropriate instruction mix
- **Memory Latency**: Use memory hierarchy effectively
