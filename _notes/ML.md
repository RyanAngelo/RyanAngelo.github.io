## Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Key Research Papers and Resources

[Language Models are Few-Shot Learners (GPT-3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)
The seminal paper introducing GPT-3, which demonstrated impressive few-shot learning capabilities in language models.

[Constitutional AI: A Research Agenda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07018)
Anthropic's research on developing AI systems that are both capable and aligned with human values.

[Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)
Meta's research on their open-source LLM, including architecture improvements and safety considerations.

[Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)
Important paper from OpenAI showing how model performance scales with compute, dataset size, and parameter count.

### Learning Resources

[State of GPT - Andrej Karpathy](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/db3f4859-cd30-4445-a0cd-553c3304f8e2)

[The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)
Visual guide to understanding transformer architecture, the foundation of modern LLMs.

[Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/course)
Free course covering transformer models, fine-tuning, and practical NLP tasks.

### Tools and Libraries

[Transformers Library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
Hugging Face's popular library for working with pre-trained models.

[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
Framework for developing applications powered by language models.
