Welcome to my projects! This is where I keep all the interesting things I've built - from actually useful tools to "hey, I wonder if I could..." experiments. Each project tells its own story of problem-solving, learning, and occasional late-night debugging sessions. Some of these started as solutions to real-world problems, while others grew from pure curiosity about a new technology or framework. Whether it's a polished application or an entertaining proof-of-concept, every project here taught me something valuable
