Back in the day, macOS did not have a time keeping or clock application included by default. I created Around The Clock to scratch my own itch to keep track of time spent on activities. Nowadays, I periodically update it to learn about new relevant frameworks and Swift/SwiftUI features.

Around the Clock is a simple, elegant time keeping application written in Swift for MacOS.

Around the Clock provides a stopwatch, a countdown timer, and an alarm clock in a clean interface.
